# calculator

When I first skimmed through the challenge summary on the ODP website, I thought I would 
never be able to finish it by myself. I didn't really give any attention 
to any of the points made on the page and immediately started looking for 
other tutorials and guides on how to build a JavaScript calculator.

I took a detour from the ODP and finished the entire JavaScript section on 
freeCodeCamp, simply because I didn't trust myself. Many weeks passed, 
and I came back to the calculator challenge on ODP. I actually read the 
instructions for the first time and found it to be not as challenging.

Now I don't know if I would still find it not as challenging if it wasn't 
for the countless hours I spent on freeCodeCamp or on Youtube. But I know that 
if I just take a moment and read instructions, no challenge is challenging.

My approach for the calculator may not be cleanest or the most optimal, but 
it is my approach and it tought me a lot on the way. I'm glad I didn't 
follow any tutorials or guides.
